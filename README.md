Developers must copy/paste the first JavaScript script tag into index.html in
order to edit this project - it is not included in the source code for obvious
security reasons. This bit of script can be found after logging into Qrid Quiz
Game's firebase console and copy/pasting the code that pops up after hitting
"Add Firebase to your web app."

Do not leave the previously pasted code in the index.html when you push to GitHub.

This app is also deployed using Firebase's CLI, which you will need to install
in order to redeploy (it's available as an npm package).
	$ npm install -g firebase-tools
Redeploy with
	$ firebase deploy

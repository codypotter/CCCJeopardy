User Set up
1. Follow link to the game
2. Read the url parameters to get the game ID. 
3. Read game from firebase @gameID

Firebase stuffs
1. read a specific value
2. write a value
3. create a listener

Buzzing in
we could do it as a listener for each user, and then when they buzz in, it turns their individual listener off
so then if someone hit the buzzer, and answered wrong,
then the next person who hit it would get to answer next instead of restarting the order

Reading Questions
1. Read character by character
2. Buzzer listener should interrupt this process. 
3. If user gets it wrong, it should show the rest of the question.
